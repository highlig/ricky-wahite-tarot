    "description": "A new journey begins with instinct, not information. Drawn by wonder that overcomes fear. Trust rises before certainty and opens the gate to both freedom and folly.",
    "visual_description": "The Fool is Brad, standing at the edge of a cliff, caught in the first breath of a journey. His loose, flowing garments evoke freedom and non-attachment. Gazing skyward, head tilted in wonder, he seems entranced by possibility rather than grounded in the path. A small satchel—light baggage, literal and metaphorical—suggests only the bare essentials of memory are carried forward. Between his feet sits a calm white kitten, wide-eyed and upward-looking. Unlike the traditional barking dog, the kitten symbolizes curiosity, vulnerability, and quiet intuition. Its stillness beneath the Fool emphasizes presence within uncertainty. Behind them, a stylized sun rises over the Wind River Range—a symbol of divine spark and unshaped potential. The cliffside is clear and earthy, offering real danger without dramatics. This is not a card of peril, but of invitation.",
    "general_meaning": "The Fool represents beginnings\u2014the sacred first step into the unknown. It is a card of potential, curiosity, and intuitive risk. There is no map yet, only a call. The Fool moves without fear not because danger is absent, but because wonder outweighs hesitation. This card invites openness, trust, and an embrace of possibility. The Fool may also ask: Are you ready to be seen as na\u00efve in order to grow? Are you willing to take the first step, even if you don\u2019t know where it leads?",
    "love": "In love readings, The Fool often signals new beginnings\u2014a budding relationship, a chance to approach love with fresh eyes, or the shedding of old patterns to make room for surprise. It suggests lightness and presence, a willingness to be vulnerable or emotionally spontaneous. In existing relationships, it may ask one or both partners to reconnect with playfulness, honesty, and trust. Sometimes it speaks to taking a leap of faith together, even if you can\u2019t see the outcome clearly. Be mindful: the Fool doesn\u2019t promise permanence\u2014it asks you to say yes to the experience.",
    "spiritual": "The Fool is the archetypal pilgrim\u2014not a teacher or master, but the one who walks. Spiritually, this card represents an openness to divine flow, a readiness to listen rather than lead, and an invitation to begin again. It\u2019s a reminder that spiritual evolution starts with surrender\u2014not knowing. The white kitten reflects a childlike intuition, an inner voice that\u2019s quiet but potent. Trust what you sense, not what others demand to be true.",
    "career": "The Fool in career readings can indicate a new opportunity, project, or path\u2014especially one that defies logic but feels aligned. It may involve a move, a creative risk, or stepping into a role that requires growth and humility. Expect the unexpected; this card often heralds non-linear success. Financially, the Fool encourages experimentation and freedom\u2014but with a warning not to leap without some preparation. Pack light, not blind.",
    "reversed": "Reversed, The Fool suggests hesitation, recklessness, or naivety. The leap becomes a stumble. You may be ignoring real risks or resisting change out of fear. Sometimes, it\u2019s not time to move\u2014more reflection is needed. Other times, it\u2019s a call to take the leap but with greater awareness. The kitten, in reversal, may point to ignored intuition or misplaced trust. Ask yourself: Are you running toward growth or away from responsibility? Are you confusing spontaneity with avoidance?"

   "visual_description": "The Magician is portrayed as Ricky, honoring his role in bringing the deck to life and his uncanny ability to turn nonsense into reality. He stands with one hand raised to the sky and the other pointing to the ground—a gesture of 'as above, so below' that marks him as the conduit between vision and form. Laid before him are four symbolic tools: a cup, a sword, a wand, and a pentacle, representing the suits and the powers of creation already at his disposal. Above his head floats the infinity symbol, denoting boundless potential and focused intent. His expression is confident, slightly amused, as if mid-spell or mid-joke—or both. The backdrop features blooming flowers and radiant swirls of energy, suggesting vitality, charged possibility, and a sense that the air itself might shimmer with becoming. Ricky’s presence reframes the archetype with personal flair: part performer, part channel, and all manifestation.",
   "general_meaning": "The Magician is a card of manifestation, action, and alignment. It signals a moment when intention, skill, and timing converge. You have what you need\u2014the tools, the drive, the clarity. The question is: will you use them? This card calls for deliberate creation, not passive wishing. It speaks to your ability to shape reality through focus, confidence, and conscious choice. When the Magician appears, the window is open. Speak clearly. Move decisively. Don\u2019t wait for more signs\u2014this is it.",
   "love": "In love, the Magician signals charisma, attraction, and intentional connection. If you\u2019re single, it can suggest someone with charm and focus entering your life\u2014or your own readiness to manifest the kind of relationship you want, rather than waiting for it. In established relationships, this card asks: Are you actively co-creating, or letting things drift? The Magician brings the reminder that desire and energy need direction. Speak your needs. Set the tone. It can also point to illusion or manipulation\u2014especially if other cards show imbalance. Is what\u2019s being offered real? Or just skillfully performed?",
   "spiritual": "Spiritually, the Magician is the first conscious awakening of power\u2014the realization that you are not a passive participant in your life, but a co-creator. This card invites you to clarify your will, align your thoughts and actions, and recognize your capacity to influence reality. Ritual, affirmation, creative practices, and direct energetic work are especially powerful under this card. You are in the \u201cdoing\u201d phase of spiritual growth\u2014not retreat, not surrender, but active engagement with the unseen. It\u2019s also a reminder: power without intention is just noise.",
   "career": "In career readings, the Magician signals a green light for action. You have the talent, the tools, and the timing. It may be time to pitch an idea, apply for something bold, or step into a more visible or leadership role. This card can also indicate a moment of persuasive clarity: presentations, interviews, negotiations, and strategy are favored when the Magician appears. Financially, it may be a good time to initiate projects that require will and effort\u2014investments, new ventures, entrepreneurial work. But it comes with a caveat: results depend on how skillfully you wield what\u2019s in front of you.",
   "reversed": "Reversed, the Magician warns of manipulation, misalignment, or lost potential. The tools are there, but they\u2019re scattered. The energy is present, but it\u2019s chaotic or self-serving. You may be faking confidence\u2014or allowing imposter syndrome to block your ability. This reversal often shows up when you\u2019re saying the right things but not doing the work, or when you\u2019re trying to control outcomes rather than channel them. It may also reflect someone else using charm or skill deceptively. Ask: Is the power being used ethically? Is this grounded in truth? Reclaim your focus. Recenter your will. The tools haven\u2019t gone anywhere\u2014they\u2019re just waiting for you to pick them up with clear hands."

   "visual_description": "The High Priestess is rendered as Pebble, seated in a centered, symmetrical pose. Her expression is serene and unreadable, wide eyes open and alert. She wears a deep blue cloak, lined in gray and patterned with faint stars, pooling softly around her paws.\n\nShe sits between two pillars: black (B for Boaz) and white (J for Jachin), symbolic of mystery and clarity, passivity and activity. These form the threshold between opposites. Behind her hangs a cream-colored veil patterned with red pomegranates, symbolizing fertility, inner wisdom, and the cycles of descent and return.\n\nPebble holds a partially unrolled scroll marked TORA between her front paws, its edge dipping into a dark, gently rippling pool at her feet. The fusion of sacred text and water suggests knowledge accessed through reflection.\n\nHer gaze is level and unwavering. She does not reveal, nor does she conceal—she waits. The card evokes duality, inner knowing, and the boundary between intellect and intuition.",
   "general_meaning": "The High Priestess represents the power of inner knowing. She comes when it’s time to listen rather than act—to trust what you sense, even if it defies logic or explanation. She holds the mysteries not because she is hiding them, but because you are meant to approach slowly, with care.\n\nThis card often signals a period of retreat, intuition, and subtle but profound realizations. You are being asked to hold space—not fill it.",
   "love": "This card often reflects emotional undercurrents—longings unspoken, intuitions unexplored. There may be a sense that something is shifting or unknown. The High Priestess invites you to feel before you define, and to trust subtle signals from yourself and others.\n\nIf you're single, pay attention to the energy around you. If partnered, lean into the power of listening and vulnerability. Truth may not be said aloud—but it is present.",
   "spiritual": "The High Priestess is the gateway to spiritual insight. Her presence affirms your path inward—through dreams, meditation, study, or sacred silence. This is not the moment for flashy ritual or external validation. This is a time to tend your inner temple.\n\nYou may experience intuitive breakthroughs, ancestral memory, or the feeling that you’ve known something all along. Follow that thread.",
   "career": "In practical matters, this card signals that all the facts may not be visible yet. Pause before signing, committing, or reacting. Trust your instincts, even if you can't yet articulate why. A hidden factor may be influencing events.\n\nThis is also a strong card for anyone in research, teaching, healing, or intuitive work. Your inner compass is the sharpest tool you have right now.",
   "reversed": "When reversed, the High Priestess warns of disconnection from intuition or fear of your inner voice. You may be relying too heavily on others' advice or ignoring subtle warnings. There could also be secrets—yours or someone else’s—casting confusion or mistrust into a situation.\n\nThis card reversed doesn’t mean the wisdom is gone—it means you may need to re-center, clear noise, and return to your own source of truth."

  "visual_description": "The Empress is portrayed as Summer, seated on an ornate throne surrounded by lush, stylized foliage. Her expression is serene and direct, her gaze steady beneath round glasses. Her long black hair falls over a golden imperial robe, echoing Chinese royal tradition.\n\nHer gown features blue stars, red roses, and curling floral patterns—symbols of beauty, creativity, and natural abundance. A tall pointed crown rests on her head, encircled by glowing five-pointed stars, suggesting cosmic harmony and divine authority. She wears teardrop earrings with circular motifs—elegant and deliberate.\n\nThe throne is carved with swirling patterns, mirrored by spiraling clouds and radiant beams in the sky behind her. On the left, wheat stalks rise; to the right, a winding river flows past distant trees—symbols of nourishment and receptivity.\n\nThe composition is symmetrical, warm, and full of life. Summer sits not as a remote ideal, but as a sovereign of the natural world—calm, grounded, and effortlessly generative.",
  "general_meaning": "The Empress represents nourishment, fertility, and embodied abundance. She is the archetype of care—not just maternal love, but the deeper force of sustaining presence. Whether in relationships, art, the body, or the land, The Empress calls you to cultivate—not by force, but by trust and attention.\n\nShe is not a provider of answers; she is the one who makes it possible for things to thrive.\n\nThis card asks: What are you tending? What wants to grow through you? Are you offering it enough light, softness, and time?",
  "love": "The Empress suggests warmth, generosity, and sensual connection. In new relationships, she brings a sense of ease and emotional flow. In existing ones, she reminds you that intimacy grows when both partners feel safe, nourished, and seen.\n\nThis card may also represent someone with Empress energy—strong, soft, patient, and magnetic—or a desire for that kind of bond. Her presence often points to emotional ripening, even potential for pregnancy or long-term commitment.\n\nBut most importantly, The Empress asks you to love from fullness, not need.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, The Empress invites you into your body, your rituals, and your rhythms. Growth isn’t always vertical—it can be slow, deep, and cyclical. This is a card of grounded devotion: tending altars, walking in nature, honoring the sacred in the ordinary.\n\nRather than seeking escape or ascension, you’re asked to root down, to trust the wisdom of your flesh, and to remember that care itself is holy.",
  "career": "In career readings, The Empress signals creative abundance, steady expansion, and supportive environments. This may be a fertile time for launching a project, nurturing a team, or investing energy into something that brings beauty or connection into the world.\n\nFinancially, this card encourages sustainable prosperity. It supports long-term investments, not risky maneuvers. Work that aligns with your values will feel more fruitful now than work that’s purely strategic.\n\nThe Empress also warns against burnout: your productivity is not your worth.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, The Empress may point to a lack of nurturing—toward yourself, your work, or someone you care for. You may be running dry, giving without replenishing, or withholding care from something that needs it.\n\nIt can also signal over-nurturing: smothering, enabling, or becoming lost in someone else’s needs. Boundaries matter, even for the Empress.\n\nAsk: Am I tending the garden—or trying to control it? What would it mean to give from wholeness, not depletion?"

A golden crown of fire hovers above his head, radiating into a starry twilight sky.\n\nHe wears layered red robes with a high collar, wrapped diagonally in a style blending martial and monastic forms. His right hand holds an upright golden ankh; in his left rests a glowing orb of power.\n\nRam heads flank the throne’s back, with stylized rams engraved in the card’s lower corners—symbols of Aries and fire. Behind him rise the sharp granite ridges of Tuolumne. The mountains mark not only strength and clarity, but a personal bet lost—a reminder that Ti still owes Ricky a climbing trip there.\n\nA river winds through the peaks, balancing fire and stone. Red flames adorn the card’s upper corners, and golden spirals drift from the crown.\n\nThis is will shaped into form. Ti rules not by force but by presence—and memory of the mountain still to come.",
  "general_meaning": "The Emperor represents structure, stability, and intentional leadership. He does not chase control but embodies it. His presence signals a time to take responsibility, define boundaries, and lead with clarity and consistency.\n\nHe reminds us that power without grounding becomes tyranny—but structure with purpose becomes legacy. This card invites you to build something lasting by stepping fully into your role.",
  "love": "In love readings, the Emperor suggests commitment, protection, and a steady foundation. He may represent a partner who is loyal, grounded, and dependable—or a call to bring more structure and clarity to your emotional life.\n\nSometimes, this card warns against emotional detachment or dominance in relationships. Love should be strong, but not controlling. Ask: Are you leading together, or pulling in different directions?",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, the Emperor grounds vision into form. This is a time to build practices, honor discipline, and shape belief into action.

  "reversed": "Reversed, the Emperor warns of imbalance in power dynamics. You may be too rigid, controlling, or resistant to outside input—or you may be avoiding structure entirely, feeling unanchored or unmotivated.\n\nThis card often appears when ego overshadows clarity. Ask: Is the system serving you, or are you serving the system? Are you leading from fear—or from strength?\n\nSometimes, the answer isn’t more control—it’s trust in what you’ve already built."

A third hand emerges from his robe, holding a scroll—its presence neither hidden nor emphasized.\n\nAt his sides sit two cats. Sid, a tabby on the left, gazes forward calmly, unfazed by the miracle. Pebble, a fluffy Maine Coon on the right, is wide-eyed and open-mouthed, frozen in comic shock.\n\nThey reflect dual responses to tradition: familiarity and awe.\n\nThe stonework around them is carved with vines, lotuses, and sacred geometry. Two pillars support the arch above, and the background glows in green and gold—signs of reverence and generational wisdom.\n\nBrad does not guard knowledge—he offers it. How it’s received is up to you.",
  "general_meaning": "The Hierophant represents lineage, wisdom, and the power of spiritual tradition. It speaks to the value of guidance, mentorship, and learning through trusted systems or teachers. This card often appears when you’re seeking deeper understanding—and the path forward may be illuminated by someone who has walked it before.\n\nIt also challenges you to consider your role in the chain of transmission: Are you the student, the keeper, or the one who disrupts the flow to forge a new way?",
  "love": "In love, the Hierophant suggests a relationship grounded in shared values, cultural or spiritual traditions, or formal commitment. It can signal marriage, family expectations, or mentorship within a partnership.\n\nIf you're seeking love, it may point to someone who shares your belief system—or challenge you to examine how past conditioning shapes your expectations.

Or following rules without meaning?",
  "reversed": "Reversed, the Hierophant can point to dogma, misuse of authority, or spiritual rigidity. You may be clinging to outdated beliefs or resisting growth because of fear masked as tradition.\n\nAlternatively, it may signal the need to rebel—to break away from systems that no longer reflect your truth. But even rebellion needs reflection. Ask yourself: What are you rejecting—and what are you replacing it with?"

Whether you’re at the beginning of something or in the midst of something long-standing, it calls for honesty and intention. Are you showing up fully?

Connection, purpose, and shared vision matter.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, The Lovers points to conflict, indecision, or misalignment. A relationship may be strained, a commitment faltering, or a tempting shortcut undermining long-term integrity.\n\nIt may also signal a failure to choose—drifting instead of engaging.

True growth doesn't come from escaping hardship, but from facing it with integrity. Let your spiritual practice hold space for your whole self—fears, flaws, and all.",
  "career": "Professionally, Strength can indicate a time to navigate tension with grace. You may be in a leadership position that requires steadiness, or facing a challenge that asks for quiet resilience. It’s not about being the loudest voice—it’s about being the calm center that others trust.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, Strength may point to insecurity, burnout, or a struggle to stand in your power. You might be repressing emotions or acting out of fear. It can also show up when you’re trying to appear strong instead of *being* strong. Take a breath. Soften. True courage includes rest, tears, and asking for help when needed."

  "description": "The way forward is not always out, but in. Clarity arrives in silence. The Hermit seeks no followers—only the truth of his own path.",
  "visual_description": "Ricky appears as the Hermit, cloaked in textured robes and leaning on a wooden staff, standing at the edge of a rocky outcrop in the Cirque of the Towers. His expression is serious, focused inward, his face partially shadowed by the hood.\n\nIn his right hand, he raises a metal lantern—simple, functional—casting a steady glow on the trail ahead. Its light feels sacred, earned through effort.\n\nThe background is notably sparse. Towering granite peaks surround him, drawn directly from the Cirque. There’s no village, no companions—only stone, ridgelines, and sky. The emptiness is deliberate: a space for reflection.\n\nMinimal ornamental elements frame the image. A faint sacred geometry symbol hovers above his hood, suggesting alignment with the eternal.\n\nThis is not a card of drama or spectacle, but of quiet clarity. It evokes solitude not as isolation, but as chosen stillness—an inward path lit from within.",
  "general_meaning": "The Hermit represents a turning inward. When this card appears, it’s time to withdraw from noise and seek your own light. This is not avoidance—it’s discernment. Something within you is asking to be heard, but only in silence can it speak.\n\nYou may be seeking clarity, healing, or deeper insight. Trust that your own inner lantern is enough to guide you through. There is wisdom in slowing down, in pulling back, in honoring the wilderness within.",
  "love": "In love readings, The Hermit can indicate space, healing, or a break from connection. If single, it may suggest a period of intentional solitude—one that clarifies what you truly want. If partnered, it may point to one or both people needing time alone to reflect.\n\nThis card doesn’t necessarily mean distance forever—but it does ask: are you growing alongside each other, or clinging out of fear? It’s a call to reconnect with your own truth before merging further.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, The Hermit is a pilgrimage. It signals deep introspection, a time when outer guidance fades and inner wisdom rises. You may be less interested in doctrine, more drawn to personal practice—walking, writing, sitting with the stars.\n\nThere may be discomfort in this kind of quiet, especially if you’re used to seeking answers outside yourself. But the lantern is lit. The way is slow, and holy.",
  "career": "In work or creative life, this card may suggest a solo venture, research phase, or time away from the spotlight. Step back from external validation. Not every idea needs immediate exposure.\n\nIf you're stuck, turn inward rather than pushing harder. Trust your instincts over trends. The Hermit’s message: create from integrity, not approval.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, The Hermit can indicate unhealthy isolation or avoidance. You may be retreating out of fear, hiding from life instead of seeking wisdom.\n\nAlternatively, you may be resisting solitude—distracting yourself from inner truths that want to be faced. The card may ask you to examine your relationship with aloneness. Are you using it to heal—or to disappear?\n\nFind balance. You don’t need to vanish to find yourself. But you do need to listen."

She wears a striped pharaonic headdress and holds a raised sword, symbolizing clarity and enigma. One paw rests on the wheel itself, anchoring her amid the swirl of fate.\n\nThe wheel is inscribed with two interlocking rings: the outer shows T-A-R-O and the Hebrew יהוה (YHWH), referencing divine mystery and the tarot’s cyclic nature. The inner ring resembles a compass rose or astrological glyphs, suggesting direction and cosmic order.\n\nSurrounding the wheel are four winged beings—a man, eagle, lion, and ox—each reading from a book, symbolizing elemental balance and enduring wisdom.\n\nA red Typhon descends on one side, and Anubis rises with a staff on the other, marking the wheel’s constant motion between gain and loss.\n\nClouds spiral in the background, evoking unseen forces. Lia’s expression remains calm, reminding us that even within chaos, stillness and clarity endure.",
  "general_meaning": "The Wheel of Fortune marks a turning point. It signals movement, change, and often events outside your control. Luck may be shifting—up or down—but the lesson is the same: hold your center.\n\nYou may feel as if the universe is steering events more than your choices are. Sometimes that’s true. But the Wheel reminds us that fortune turns, always. Whether this moment is blessing or challenge, it won’t last. What matters is your response.",

Be open to what unfolds, and avoid clinging to outcomes.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, this card is a reminder that time, karma, and destiny all move in cycles. You may be entering a phase of alignment or transition. Trust the larger pattern.

  "career": "Career-wise, the Wheel may bring opportunity, unpredictability, or shifts in direction. Promotions, layoffs, mergers, and lucky breaks all fall under this card’s domain. The challenge is to stay flexible and responsive.\n\nIf you’ve been waiting for a sign to act—this may be it. Strike while the wheel is turning, but don’t get attached to any single outcome.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, the Wheel suggests resistance to change, or clinging to control in a situation that requires surrender. You may be feeling unlucky, stuck, or at the mercy of external events.\n\nThis card may ask you to loosen your grip. What patterns are repeating? What lesson is trying to be learned? Until it is, the wheel may spin in place.\n\nChange is inevitable. Growth is optional."

In his left, he holds a balanced golden scale, unladen and even, representing fairness and moral clarity. Behind him hangs a maroon curtain, flanked by stone columns. The throne is etched with ornate patterns, and beneath it rests a stylized eye-in-triangle, evoking higher awareness. His left foot extends forward, revealing a single white sneaker—a detail found in traditional depictions of Justice. The white shoe signifies purity of intention and personal responsibility in ethical choices. The whole composition is symmetrical, steady, and deliberate—underscoring clarity, accountability, and the enduring presence of truth.",
  "general_meaning": "Justice calls for truth, responsibility, and an honest look at the cause-and-effect forces shaping your life. You may be asked to make a fair decision, own your part in a situation, or hold others accountable.\n\nThis card affirms that integrity matters. If you’ve been wronged, Justice suggests that truth will come to light. If you’re avoiding accountability, it’s time to come clean. What you put out returns.",
  "love": "In relationships, Justice brings clarity and consequences. It may ask you to reflect on whether your partnership is fair, balanced, and rooted in mutual respect. Are both people being honest? Are both voices being heard?\n\nIt can also signal decisions around contracts, commitments, or legal matters like divorce or marriage.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, Justice asks you to align your actions with your values. It’s a reminder that karma operates through patterns—what you choose, how you treat others, and how you show up in difficult moments.\n\nThis card encourages discernment, honesty, and spiritual maturity. The path to wisdom often requires confronting uncomfortable truths.",
  "career": "In career readings, Justice may point to legal matters, contracts, or ethical dilemmas. You may be facing scrutiny or being asked to evaluate the fairness of your situation.\n\nThis is a card of accountability—what have you earned, and what have you avoided? Stand by your principles and document your choices.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, Justice may reveal dishonesty, bias, or corruption. You may be on the receiving end of an unfair decision—or avoiding responsibility for your own actions.\n\nThis card warns against denial and defensiveness. If things feel unbalanced, take a hard look at how you got here. If you’re being wronged, advocate clearly and persistently. Justice delayed is not always justice denied, but it must be pursued."

A radiant golden halo glows behind her, emphasizing calm awareness and transcendence. Her face is peaceful and gently smiling, suggesting clarity through surrender. She gazes out at the viewer from her reversed vantage with serene curiosity.\n\nThe background is filled with swirling, ink-like clouds in deep slate and cream tones, evoking movement and contemplation. Leaves frame the top of the image, just visible above the thick branch—grounding the composition in nature. There is no ground below her—only sky and the idea of perspective, suspended.",
  "general_meaning": "The Hanged indicates a time of pause and suspension. It calls for surrender—willingly letting go of control in order to gain a new perspective. This is not passive avoidance, but conscious stillness.

By choosing stillness, you invite a shift in perception.",

  "spiritual": "Spiritually, this card invites contemplation and surrender. You're being asked to trust the process—even when it feels upside down. Stillness is sacred. Wisdom will emerge from the pause.\n\nMeditate. Reflect. Loosen your grip on the outcome. This is the space in which true transformation begins.",
  "career": "Career-wise, The Hanged may point to delays, transitions, or a period of limbo. You may feel stuck or uncertain.

Insight is coming, but it needs space.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, The Hanged suggests resistance to surrender. You may be clinging to control, unwilling to let go—even when doing so would bring peace. This can also reflect victimhood or playing the martyr, staying stuck by choice.\n\nYou’re being asked to shift your perspective. Let go of the need for immediate resolution. Stillness is not failure. It is the beginning of clarity."

To one side kneels Brad as the Hierophant, head bowed in reverence. On the other side is Summer, the Empress, hands pressed to her face in awe and sorrow. A young girl with flowers in her hair watches—innocence witnessing an ending. Behind them, a river winds toward the horizon, and a red sun rises between two towers—symbols of threshold and rebirth.

If love continues, it will be reborn on new terms. If not, honor what was, and move forward.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, Death is a powerful threshold. Something in your old worldview may be dying. This is not a crisis—it’s an initiation. Your path is shedding skin. You may feel uncertain or lost. That’s the space before clarity.\n\nTrust in the process. Grieve, release, then begin again. This is sacred composting.",
  "career": "In work, Death can mean a job ending, a project wrapping up, or a career pivot on the horizon. It might feel like a door closing—but that may be a blessing in disguise.\n\nTake time to understand what is truly ending. Then shift your energy. Don’t resist the inevitable. Something new is waiting.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, Death suggests resistance. You may be holding on to something long past its expiration—out of fear, habit, or denial. This creates stagnation. You’re stuck in a chapter that wants to end.\n\nFace the fear of change. Acknowledge what’s dying. Releasing it is painful, but staying locked in place is worse.\n\nEvery ending holds a seed."

He wears a white robe marked with the alchemical symbol for water, and large red wings extend from his back. A glowing crown hovers above his dark, curled hair, surrounded by a soft golden halo. He pours water from one golden chalice to another, the stream bending mid-air in a curved arc shaped by invisible forces. His right foot touches the river lightly, while his left hovers just above—neither plunging in nor recoiling, poised in quiet balance. Behind him, a winding golden path leads to a distant Bear’s Lodge beneath a sunrise sky. Purple irises bloom on both banks, symbols of wisdom, growth, and emotional clarity. Spiraling clouds above echo the gentle rhythm below. This is a card of balance in motion—of patience not as stillness, but as flow: adaptive, quiet, and harmonized without force.",
  "general_meaning": "Temperance invites you to find your center. Rather than extremes or quick fixes, it asks for careful balance, quiet integration, and a trust in process.

  "love": "In love, Temperance points to relationships where mutual understanding and compromise are key. It encourages emotional maturity, honest communication, and healthy pacing—especially after a time of conflict or imbalance.\n\nIf single, this card suggests healing and self-integration that prepares you for deeper connection ahead.",

  "career": "In career matters, Temperance suggests collaboration, long-term planning, and the balancing of ambition with sustainability.

His eyes gleam with knowing mischief, and a golden inverted pentagram glows behind his head like a taunting halo. He wears an Abyssal Frost denim battle vest—definitely not a Double E’s cut—and grips a flame-etched electric guitar shaped like a hellish chalice. One hand flashes the metal horns, bridging satire and summon. Below him, two chained figures—one with grapes on her tail, the other with a flame—kneel at the pedestal’s base, wrists loosely bound. Their faces suggest discomfort tinged with desire, unsure if they want escape or just more of the same. The background swirls with smoke and twisted gothic archways, blending concert poster and cathedral fresco. It’s richly textured, heavy with irony. Kenan’s devil doesn’t need to trap you—you’re already holding the leash.",

It may also highlight an inability to let go of someone—even when you know it’s hurting you.\n\nAlternatively, it can speak to raw passion, irresistible attraction, or taboo dynamics. The key is whether the bond empowers or ensnares.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, this card is a shadow work invitation. Where are you giving your power away? What do you avoid seeing?

  "career": "Career-wise, The Devil may represent a toxic work environment, golden handcuffs, or unsustainable ambition. It could also reflect burnout, over-identification with success, or fear-based choices.\n\nThis card asks you to consider: what are you sacrificing, and is it worth it? What fear is driving your hustle?",
  "reversed": "Reversed, this card signals the start of liberation. You may be recognizing the illusion or seeing the chains for what they are. It’s a sign you’re ready to let go of limiting beliefs or toxic patterns.\n\nAlternatively, it can warn of deeper denial—clinging even harder to what no longer serves you. Don’t numb out. Wake up."

He reaches not for the crown, but for the wig—eyes wide, desperate to recover at least that part of his fallen glory.\n\nRicky, falling on the other side, is more composed. Though his wig has also been cast off in the explosion, his limbs are relaxed, and his expression is one of almost meditative surrender. He seems to know it’s over—and maybe even that it needed to be.\n\nThe tower itself is torn apart, flames pouring from every breach.

  "reversed": "Reversed, The Tower may suggest that you’re avoiding an inevitable collapse. You feel the rumblings, but you’re still trying to hold up a structure that’s past saving.

That path snakes toward two towers in the background—set against a mountain range unmistakably modeled on Giuseppe Pingora’s Peak and Wolf’s Head in Wyoming’s Cirque of the Towers.\n\nThe entire scene is infused with curls of mist, stylized clouds, and dreamlike flourishes. This is a realm of the subconscious and symbolic—a card that asks more questions than it answers.",
  "general_meaning": "The Moon card reflects a time of uncertainty, dreams, or emotional intensity. Things may not be what they seem. Trust your gut more than appearances. Move slowly and let intuition guide you.\n\nSometimes, the Moon reveals buried feelings or long-lost fears surfacing again. Don’t rush to fix or define—just notice. What’s unclear now will come into focus later.",
  "love": "In relationships, the Moon can point to emotional confusion, projection, or unspoken fears. You or your partner may be acting from insecurity or illusion. This is a time for patience—not big decisions.\n\nIf single, your attraction to someone may be based more on fantasy than reality. Let time and clarity emerge before jumping in.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, the Moon opens a gateway to dreams, intuition, and shadow work. You may receive insight in non-rational ways—symbols, dreams, synchronicities.\n\nIt’s also a time for caution: not everything coming up now is trustworthy. Use discernment. Let what’s unclear stay unclear until it’s ready.",
  "career": "In work, this card suggests unclear circumstances or workplace dynamics driven by rumor, insecurity, or hidden agendas. Avoid overanalyzing. Instead, document your decisions, stick to facts, and wait for clarity.\n\nThe Moon may also indicate a creative phase driven by unconscious inspiration—trust the muse, but double-check the contract.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, the Moon can reveal that confusion is lifting—or that fear is clouding your instincts. You may be doubting your inner voice or stuck in old illusions. This is a call to slow down, center yourself, and reflect.\n\nIt may also point to emotional overwhelm or anxiety. Create space to ground. Not every feeling is fact—but all deserve compassion."

  "description": "Bob Marley sits in meditation atop a sea turtle, dressed in flowing garments patterned like ocean currents. A golden chalice steams gently in one hand, while the other grips a simple scepter. Behind him, waves rise and swirl, a fish jumps, and a ship sails into a glowing sunset. His expression is steady, present—both detached and deeply feeling. A crown rests calmly on his head, signaling a ruler who leads with empathy and clarity.",
