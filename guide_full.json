    "description": "A new journey begins with instinct, not information. Drawn by wonder that overcomes fear. Trust rises before certainty and opens the gate to both freedom and folly.",
    "visual_description": "The Fool stands at the edge of a cliff, caught in the first breath of a journey. Their loose, flowing garments evoke freedom and non-attachment. Gazing skyward, head tilted in wonder, they seem entranced by possibility rather than grounded in the path. A small satchel—light baggage, literal and metaphorical—suggests only the bare essentials of memory are carried forward. Between their feet sits a calm white kitten, wide-eyed and upward-looking. Unlike the traditional barking dog, the kitten symbolizes curiosity, vulnerability, and quiet intuition. Its stillness beneath the Fool emphasizes presence within uncertainty. Behind them, a stylized sun or radiant burst rises—a symbol of divine spark and unshaped potential. The cliffside is clear and earthy, offering real danger without dramatics. This is not a card of peril, but of invitation.",
    "general_meaning": "The Fool represents beginnings\u2014the sacred first step into the unknown. It is a card of potential, curiosity, and intuitive risk. There is no map yet, only a call. The Fool moves without fear not because danger is absent, but because wonder outweighs hesitation. This card invites openness, trust, and an embrace of possibility. The Fool may also ask: Are you ready to be seen as na\u00efve in order to grow? Are you willing to take the first step, even if you don\u2019t know where it leads?",
    "love": "In love readings, The Fool often signals new beginnings\u2014a budding relationship, a chance to approach love with fresh eyes, or the shedding of old patterns to make room for surprise. It suggests lightness and presence, a willingness to be vulnerable or emotionally spontaneous. In existing relationships, it may ask one or both partners to reconnect with playfulness, honesty, and trust. Sometimes it speaks to taking a leap of faith together, even if you can\u2019t see the outcome clearly. Be mindful: the Fool doesn\u2019t promise permanence\u2014it asks you to say yes to the experience.",
    "spiritual": "The Fool is the archetypal pilgrim\u2014not a teacher or master, but the one who walks. Spiritually, this card represents an openness to divine flow, a readiness to listen rather than lead, and an invitation to begin again. It\u2019s a reminder that spiritual evolution starts with surrender\u2014not knowing. The white kitten reflects a childlike intuition, an inner voice that\u2019s quiet but potent. Trust what you sense, not what others demand to be true.",
    "career": "The Fool in career readings can indicate a new opportunity, project, or path\u2014especially one that defies logic but feels aligned. It may involve a move, a creative risk, or stepping into a role that requires growth and humility. Expect the unexpected; this card often heralds non-linear success. Financially, the Fool encourages experimentation and freedom\u2014but with a warning not to leap without some preparation. Pack light, not blind.",
    "reversed": "Reversed, The Fool suggests hesitation, recklessness, or naivety. The leap becomes a stumble. You may be ignoring real risks or resisting change out of fear. Sometimes, it\u2019s not time to move\u2014more reflection is needed. Other times, it\u2019s a call to take the leap but with greater awareness. The kitten, in reversal, may point to ignored intuition or misplaced trust. Ask yourself: Are you running toward growth or away from responsibility? Are you confusing spontaneity with avoidance?"

   "visual_description": "The Magician stands poised between worlds. One arm reaches upward, fingers extended to the unseen, while the other points down toward the earth\u2014forming a conduit between the divine and the material. This classic posture, often referred to as \u201cas above, so below,\u201d emphasizes his role as the bridge between inspiration and reality. Laid before him are four tools\u2014each representing the suits of the tarot: a cup, a sword, a wand, and a pentacle. These are not simply props; they are elements of creation, gifts already at hand. The message is clear: everything needed is already here, waiting for alignment and intention. Above his head, the symbol of infinity floats\u2014an emblem of limitless potential and the boundless nature of focused will. The background often shows blooming flowers or a luminous space, signifying vitality, manifestation, and a charged atmosphere ready to respond. Where the Fool was pure potential, the Magician begins to shape that potential into form. He is both stage performer and spiritual channel\u2014one who blends mystery with execution.",
   "general_meaning": "The Magician is a card of manifestation, action, and alignment. It signals a moment when intention, skill, and timing converge. You have what you need\u2014the tools, the drive, the clarity. The question is: will you use them? This card calls for deliberate creation, not passive wishing. It speaks to your ability to shape reality through focus, confidence, and conscious choice. When the Magician appears, the window is open. Speak clearly. Move decisively. Don\u2019t wait for more signs\u2014this is it.",
   "love": "In love, the Magician signals charisma, attraction, and intentional connection. If you\u2019re single, it can suggest someone with charm and focus entering your life\u2014or your own readiness to manifest the kind of relationship you want, rather than waiting for it. In established relationships, this card asks: Are you actively co-creating, or letting things drift? The Magician brings the reminder that desire and energy need direction. Speak your needs. Set the tone. It can also point to illusion or manipulation\u2014especially if other cards show imbalance. Is what\u2019s being offered real? Or just skillfully performed?",
   "spiritual": "Spiritually, the Magician is the first conscious awakening of power\u2014the realization that you are not a passive participant in your life, but a co-creator. This card invites you to clarify your will, align your thoughts and actions, and recognize your capacity to influence reality. Ritual, affirmation, creative practices, and direct energetic work are especially powerful under this card. You are in the \u201cdoing\u201d phase of spiritual growth\u2014not retreat, not surrender, but active engagement with the unseen. It\u2019s also a reminder: power without intention is just noise.",
   "career": "In career readings, the Magician signals a green light for action. You have the talent, the tools, and the timing. It may be time to pitch an idea, apply for something bold, or step into a more visible or leadership role. This card can also indicate a moment of persuasive clarity: presentations, interviews, negotiations, and strategy are favored when the Magician appears. Financially, it may be a good time to initiate projects that require will and effort\u2014investments, new ventures, entrepreneurial work. But it comes with a caveat: results depend on how skillfully you wield what\u2019s in front of you.",
   "reversed": "Reversed, the Magician warns of manipulation, misalignment, or lost potential. The tools are there, but they\u2019re scattered. The energy is present, but it\u2019s chaotic or self-serving. You may be faking confidence\u2014or allowing imposter syndrome to block your ability. This reversal often shows up when you\u2019re saying the right things but not doing the work, or when you\u2019re trying to control outcomes rather than channel them. It may also reflect someone else using charm or skill deceptively. Ask: Is the power being used ethically? Is this grounded in truth? Reclaim your focus. Recenter your will. The tools haven\u2019t gone anywhere\u2014they\u2019re just waiting for you to pick them up with clear hands."

   },
   "description": "Silence holds what cannot be explained. Truth emerges through stillness; what is hidden offers guidance to those who listen inward.",
   "visual_description": "The High Priestess is rendered as a cat—Pebble—seated in a centered, symmetrical pose. Her expression is serene but unreadable, large eyes open and alert, as if absorbing everything and revealing nothing. She wears a deep blue cloak, lined in gray and patterned faintly with stars. The fabric pools around her paws, framing her in stillness.\n\nShe sits between two pillars: one black with the letter B and one white with the letter J. These represent Boaz and Jachin, names drawn from the entrance of the Temple of Solomon. Boaz (black) symbolizes strength, passivity, and mystery; Jachin (white) represents establishment, activity, and clarity. Together, they form the gateway between opposites—dark and light, hidden and seen, inner and outer.\n\nBehind Pebble is a cream-colored veil, densely patterned with red pomegranates. The veil obscures what lies beyond, suggesting that sacred knowledge is guarded but not unreachable. The pomegranates represent fertility, inner wisdom, and cycles of transformation, and echo mythic descent and return, such as Persephone’s journey to and from the underworld.\n\nPebble holds a partially unrolled scroll marked TORA between her front paws, and gently dips it into a shallow pool of water at her feet. This action signifies the fusion of written knowledge and intuitive depth—the sacred text immersed in reflection. The water is dark and gently rippling, disturbed by the scroll’s contact. It adds a sense of movement and emotional depth to an otherwise composed and symmetrical scene.\n\nPebble’s gaze is level. She is not withholding the truth, but neither is she offering it freely. The scene is symmetrical, muted, and saturated with layered meaning—duality, inner knowing, feminine power, and the boundary between what is known and what must be sensed.",
   "general_meaning": "The High Priestess represents the power of inner knowing. She comes when it’s time to listen rather than act—to trust what you sense, even if it defies logic or explanation. She holds the mysteries not because she is hiding them, but because you are meant to approach slowly, with care.\n\nThis card often signals a period of retreat, intuition, and subtle but profound realizations. You are being asked to hold space—not fill it.",
   "love": "This card often reflects emotional undercurrents—longings unspoken, intuitions unexplored. There may be a sense that something is shifting or unknown. The High Priestess invites you to feel before you define, and to trust subtle signals from yourself and others.\n\nIf you're single, pay attention to the energy around you. If partnered, lean into the power of listening and vulnerability. Truth may not be said aloud—but it is present.",
   "spiritual": "The High Priestess is the gateway to spiritual insight. Her presence affirms your path inward—through dreams, meditation, study, or sacred silence. This is not the moment for flashy ritual or external validation. This is a time to tend your inner temple.\n\nYou may experience intuitive breakthroughs, ancestral memory, or the feeling that you’ve known something all along. Follow that thread.",
   "career": "In practical matters, this card signals that all the facts may not be visible yet. Pause before signing, committing, or reacting. Trust your instincts, even if you can't yet articulate why. A hidden factor may be influencing events.\n\nThis is also a strong card for anyone in research, teaching, healing, or intuitive work. Your inner compass is the sharpest tool you have right now.",
   "reversed": "When reversed, the High Priestess warns of disconnection from intuition or fear of your inner voice. You may be relying too heavily on others' advice or ignoring subtle warnings. There could also be secrets—yours or someone else’s—casting confusion or mistrust into a situation.\n\nThis card reversed doesn’t mean the wisdom is gone—it means you may need to re-center, clear noise, and return to your own source of truth."

  "description": "Creation is not a task—it is a state. She offers not answers but abundance, not control but invitation. Growth follows care, and care begins with presence.",
  "visual_description": "The Empress is portrayed as Summer, seated on an ornate throne surrounded by lush, stylized foliage. Her expression is serene and direct, her gaze steady beneath round glasses. Her long black hair falls over her shoulders, partially tucked behind the embroidered collar of her golden robe.\n\nShe wears a rich imperial yellow gown, evoking the traditional robes of Chinese royalty. The fabric is intricately decorated with blue five-pointed stars, red roses, and curling floral patterns, symbolizing beauty, creativity, and natural abundance. A wide belt at her waist and the high collar create a formal silhouette, grounding her presence in regal tradition.\n\nA tall crown rests on her head—elaborate and pointed, it is encircled by glowing five-pointed stars, suggesting cosmic harmony, sovereignty, and divine right. She wears teardrop-shaped earrings with circular motifs, subtle but intentional.\n\nThe throne is carved with swirling patterns, echoed in the sky behind her, which is filled with spiraling clouds and rays of light that radiate outward. On either side of the throne, nature unfolds: wheat stalks rise from the lower left corner, while a winding river and grove of trees stretch across the right background. These symbols reflect nourishment, organic growth, and the flowing, receptive nature of the Empress archetype.\n\nThe entire composition is symmetrical, grounded, and rich with detail. Summer sits in full presence—not distant or divine, but entirely at ease in her power. She is the center of a world that grows because she allows it.",
  "general_meaning": "The Empress represents nourishment, fertility, and embodied abundance. She is the archetype of care—not just maternal love, but the deeper force of sustaining presence. Whether in relationships, art, the body, or the land, The Empress calls you to cultivate—not by force, but by trust and attention.\n\nShe is not a provider of answers; she is the one who makes it possible for things to thrive.\n\nThis card asks: What are you tending? What wants to grow through you? Are you offering it enough light, softness, and time?",
  "love": "The Empress suggests warmth, generosity, and sensual connection. In new relationships, she brings a sense of ease and emotional flow. In existing ones, she reminds you that intimacy grows when both partners feel safe, nourished, and seen.\n\nThis card may also represent someone with Empress energy—strong, soft, patient, and magnetic—or a desire for that kind of bond. Her presence often points to emotional ripening, even potential for pregnancy or long-term commitment.\n\nBut most importantly, The Empress asks you to love from fullness, not need.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, The Empress invites you into your body, your rituals, and your rhythms. Growth isn’t always vertical—it can be slow, deep, and cyclical. This is a card of grounded devotion: tending altars, walking in nature, honoring the sacred in the ordinary.\n\nRather than seeking escape or ascension, you’re asked to root down, to trust the wisdom of your flesh, and to remember that care itself is holy.",
  "career": "In career readings, The Empress signals creative abundance, steady expansion, and supportive environments. This may be a fertile time for launching a project, nurturing a team, or investing energy into something that brings beauty or connection into the world.\n\nFinancially, this card encourages sustainable prosperity. It supports long-term investments, not risky maneuvers. Work that aligns with your values will feel more fruitful now than work that’s purely strategic.\n\nThe Empress also warns against burnout: your productivity is not your worth.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, The Empress may point to a lack of nurturing—toward yourself, your work, or someone you care for. You may be running dry, giving without replenishing, or withholding care from something that needs it.\n\nIt can also signal over-nurturing: smothering, enabling, or becoming lost in someone else’s needs. Boundaries matter, even for the Empress.\n\nAsk: Am I tending the garden—or trying to control it? What would it mean to give from wholeness, not depletion?"

  "visual_description": "The Emperor is depicted as Ti, seated on a high stone throne, facing forward in a firm, symmetrical pose. He is bald with a close beard, his expression composed and commanding. A glowing golden crown of fire hovers just above his head, radiating upward into a cosmic night sky.\n\nHe wears layered red robes with a high collar and broad shoulders, wrapping diagonally across his chest in a style evoking both monastic and martial silhouettes. His posture is square and unmoving, both feet planted on a textured stone platform resembling cracked earth or fitted flagstone.\n\nIn his right hand, Ti holds a golden ankh—a symbol of life and authority—gripped upright like a scepter. In his left hand, resting on the arm of the throne, he cradles a small, glowing gold orb, representing dominion and worldly power.\n\nThe throne itself is massive, carved from stone with angular lines and textures that echo the surrounding environment. Ram heads protrude from both sides of the backrest, symbols of Aries, fire, and will. A pair of stylized rams are also engraved in the lower corners of the card frame.\n\nBehind him, a range of granite mountains stretches across the background—these are drawn from the Tuolumne region of the Sierra Nevada, known for their sharp ridgelines and alpine clarity. Their presence is not just symbolic of elevation and strength—they also represent a personal wager lost by Ti, and now serve as a standing reminder that he owes Ricky one climbing trip there. Like all true authority, this throne is built on accountability.\n\nA river winds below the peaks, curling between the rocks like a flowing counterbalance to the card’s fire and stone.\n\nThe arch framing the card contains stylized red flames in the top corners, one on each side. The sky behind the Emperor is a deep twilight blue, scattered with stars and swirling golden filaments that spiral outward from the crown above his head.\n\nThis is a card of will made visible. Ti does not rule by force alone—his power is rooted in presence, memory, and the mountain he still has to climb.",
  "general_meaning": "The Emperor represents structure, stability, and intentional leadership. He does not chase control but embodies it. His presence signals a time to take responsibility, define boundaries, and lead with clarity and consistency.\n\nHe reminds us that power without grounding becomes tyranny—but structure with purpose becomes legacy. This card invites you to build something lasting by stepping fully into your role.",
  "love": "In love readings, the Emperor suggests commitment, protection, and a steady foundation. He may represent a partner who is loyal, grounded, and dependable—or a call to bring more structure and clarity to your emotional life.\n\nSometimes, this card warns against emotional detachment or dominance in relationships. Love should be strong, but not controlling. Ask: Are you leading together, or pulling in different directions?",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, the Emperor grounds vision into form. This is a time to build practices, honor discipline, and shape belief into action. He reminds you that spiritual progress isn’t always mystical—it can be structured, daily, and tangible.\n\nWhether through ritual, order, or a commitment to walk your talk, the Emperor helps translate ideals into lived integrity.",
  "career": "In career readings, the Emperor speaks to leadership, management, and taking control of your environment. Whether stepping into authority or creating better systems, this is about building something that lasts.\n\nIf you’re seeking direction, this card says: make a plan. Set expectations. Bring structure to your ambition. It’s not about charisma—it’s about consistency.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, the Emperor warns of imbalance in power dynamics. You may be too rigid, controlling, or resistant to outside input—or you may be avoiding structure entirely, feeling unanchored or unmotivated.\n\nThis card often appears when ego overshadows clarity. Ask: Is the system serving you, or are you serving the system? Are you leading from fear—or from strength?\n\nSometimes, the answer isn’t more control—it’s trust in what you’ve already built."

  "visual_description": "The Hierophant is portrayed as Brad, seated cross-legged on an elevated stone platform beneath a domed arch. He wears layered, earth-toned robes and strands of prayer beads across his chest, suggesting a spiritual teacher or monk. His expression is calm, kind, and lightly amused. A wide, patterned halo radiates behind his head, echoing traditional icons of sacred authority.\n\nIn his left hand, Brad holds a tall golden staff topped with a double cross, a symbol of spiritual stewardship and connection between realms. His right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing or benediction. But notably, a third hand emerges inconspicuously from the folds of his robe, holding a scroll of teachings. The hand is neither hidden nor emphasized—its presence is accepted as part of the mystery.\n\nFlanking him are two cats, each offering a different response to the miracle at hand. On his left sits Sid, a short-haired tabby with calm, forward-facing eyes. He is utterly composed, as though he has witnessed this gesture many times before—unfazed by the third hand, and perhaps even a little bored by the ceremony.\n\nOn Brad’s right is Pebble, a long-haired Maine Coon with a white ruff and large tufted paws. Her eyes are wide, her mouth slightly open in astonishment, body tense with disbelief. She is visibly shocked by the third hand, her posture frozen in comic reverence. Together, the cats represent dual responses to tradition: knowing acceptance and fresh-eyed wonder.\n\nThe stone architecture around them is carved with curling vines, lotus blossoms, and sacred geometry. Two pillars support the arch above Brad’s head, and more lotuses are etched into the pedestal beneath him. The background is a gradient of deep greens and golds, evoking growth, reverence, and a living sacredness passed down through generations.\n\nBrad does not guard knowledge—he transmits it. But as the presence of the cats reminds us, even shared truths land differently depending on the listener.",
  "general_meaning": "The Hierophant represents lineage, wisdom, and the power of spiritual tradition. It speaks to the value of guidance, mentorship, and learning through trusted systems or teachers. This card often appears when you’re seeking deeper understanding—and the path forward may be illuminated by someone who has walked it before.\n\nIt also challenges you to consider your role in the chain of transmission: Are you the student, the keeper, or the one who disrupts the flow to forge a new way?",
  "love": "In love, the Hierophant suggests a relationship grounded in shared values, cultural or spiritual traditions, or formal commitment. It can signal marriage, family expectations, or mentorship within a partnership.\n\nIf you're seeking love, it may point to someone who shares your belief system—or challenge you to examine how past conditioning shapes your expectations. Are you honoring your truth, or just playing a role?",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, the Hierophant invites you to study, reflect, and integrate what’s been passed down. This is a card of lineage—not just biological, but energetic. Who taught your teachers? What rituals shaped your worldview?\n\nIt encourages participation in spiritual communities or wisdom traditions, but also challenges blind obedience. Listen, then decide what becomes yours to carry.",
  "career": "In career readings, the Hierophant may indicate mentorship, organizational systems, or roles tied to education, religion, or law. This is a good time to learn from established structures—or challenge and update them.\n\nIt also asks whether your current path aligns with your deeper values. Are you working with purpose? Or following rules without meaning?",
  "reversed": "Reversed, the Hierophant can point to dogma, misuse of authority, or spiritual rigidity. You may be clinging to outdated beliefs or resisting growth because of fear masked as tradition.\n\nAlternatively, it may signal the need to rebel—to break away from systems that no longer reflect your truth. But even rebellion needs reflection. Ask yourself: What are you rejecting—and what are you replacing it with?"

  "visual_description": "The Lovers features Emily and Mike Ballanco, standing barefoot and facing one another on a winding path that begins at the beachfront of Lavallette, New Jersey. They wear beach clothes adorned with fig motifs—Emily in a strapless, dark floral dress; Mike in green swim trunks printed with oversized fig leaves, echoing Adam and Eve imagery.\n\nMike stands on the right, clearly hamming it up—his arms spread wide, chest puffed, eyebrows lifted in theatrical delight. His smile is exaggerated, his stance confident and over-the-top, fully committed to the moment.\n\nEmily, on the left, looks directly at him with a knowing, slightly squinting expression. There’s a hint of embarrassment in her posture, her arms low and close to her body—but also affection and complicity. She’s seen it countless times before. And even as she braces for whatever bit Mike is about to commit to, she’s also drawn in—more than a little concerned she’s about to be roped into it.\n\nBehind them, the landscape splits symbolically. On Emily’s side, a lush vine grows upward, blooming with flowers and coiling with a serpent. On Mike’s side, flames rise from a bare, blackened tree. Life and knowledge, fire and desire.\n\nAbove them, an angel floats in radiant gold, arms extended in blessing, surrounded by swirling clouds. The figure watches without judgment, bearing witness rather than command.\n\nIn the distance, a mountain shaped after the peaks of Vail, Colorado rises beyond the path. It’s approachable but vast, traced with lines like ski lifts and gondolas—many ways up, but no shortcuts. A reminder that love is not just found, but chosen and climbed.",
  "general_meaning": "The Lovers is about meaningful connection—between people, within the self, and with the world. It often signifies romantic partnership, but at its core, this card is about conscious choice. It asks you to commit, not just to desire or chemistry, but to what love actually requires: presence, vulnerability, alignment, and effort.\n\nIt can also symbolize inner union—bringing together disparate aspects of self, or facing a decision that will shape your path forward.",

Whether you’re at the beginning of something or in the midst of something long-standing, it calls for honesty and intention. Are you showing up fully?

It may be time to examine whether your beliefs, values, and actions are in harmony—or if something needs to be reconciled.

Who or what in your life is reflecting your own longing, fear, or growth back to you?",
  "career": "The Lovers in a career context may indicate partnerships, contracts, or a major decision that will define your path.

Connection, purpose, and shared vision matter.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, The Lovers points to conflict, indecision, or misalignment. A relationship may be strained, a commitment faltering, or a tempting shortcut undermining long-term integrity.\n\nIt may also signal a failure to choose—drifting instead of engaging. Reconnect with your values. Ask honestly: What are you truly drawn to? And are you willing to show up for it?"

Her armored attire draws from her Whiteout Survival avatar: padded, practical, and unmistakably suited for command. A golden star crowns her helmet, and oversized goggles rest above her brow, combining utilitarian readiness with understated flair. Her expression is composed and forward-facing—unmoved by noise, driven by intent.\n\nTo either side of the chariot sit two ceremonial dogs. On the left, a white English bulldog wears a Manchester City scarf, marking Arden’s proud Manchesterian identity with understated loyalty and grit. On the right, a black French bulldog wears a tricolor sash in homage to her Alpine roots. These animals take the place of traditional sphinxes—not as oppositional forces, but as harmonized symbols of dual belonging. They are seated, calm, and dignified, offering presence rather than propulsion.\n\nThe background blends two homelands. On the left rises the unmistakable silhouette of the Etihad Stadium, rendered as a softly shaded cathedral of sport, silent and library-like in appearance, symbolizing both sacred devotion and the often-muted demeanor of City supporters. On the right, sharp Alpine mountains jut into the sky, towering above a quaint village—suggesting origin, ascent, and the call of legacy.\n\nRunning through the center of the image is the River Irwell, winding between geographies like a lifeline—connecting industrial England with the serenity of the mountains. The waters churn beneath the chariot’s wheels, but Arden remains centered.\n\nThis is a portrait of quiet will, inherited tension, and cultural synthesis. Arden does not charge—she steers.",
  "general_meaning": "The Chariot signifies momentum driven by alignment. It is not the chaos of speed but the force of purpose. You are being asked to direct your energy, to know what you want, and to commit to the path ahead. Success comes from inner balance and intentional movement—not brute force.",
  "love": "In relationships, The Chariot can indicate a desire to take the reins—either in pursuit or in healing. If things have felt stagnant, this card brings motion. But direction must be mutual. Are you aligned with your partner—or just dragging them along?",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, this card speaks to discipline and self-mastery. It’s not a time to drift—this is a call to focus. Choose a path. Choose it clearly. Then commit to walking it, even when the terrain gets uneven. Progress is possible—but only with focus.",
  "career": "The Chariot is a green light. Momentum is gathering, and you are at the helm. Whether it’s a promotion, relocation, or launch, you are in the driver’s seat. Don’t hesitate—but don’t bulldoze either. Strategic ambition wins.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, The Chariot warns of scattered focus, impulsive decisions, or burnout. You may be trying to steer without knowing where you're going—or forcing progress when reflection is needed. Regroup. Clarify your intention. Then move."

  "visual_description": "Strength features Bradleigh, kneeling beside a roaring lion in a golden meadow at sunrise. He wears a cream-colored gi with soft vine embroidery, belted with a rainbow flower sash. A flower crown rests on his shaved head, signaling both gentleness and quiet pride. His expression is calm, mischievous, and completely present.\n\nOne hand gently rests beneath the lion’s jaw, the other steadying its mouth—not closing it, not controlling it, but holding space. The lion’s mane blazes, but there is trust between them. This is a pact of care, not conquest.\n\nBehind them rises Devil’s Tower—bold, ancient, and sacred. Brad summited the tower via the Durrance Route in exceptional style on 9/2/23, logging the first summit of the day on a packed Labor Day weekend. The image cements that feat as an emblem of strength earned through patience, presence, and belief.\n\nAbove Brad floats the infinity symbol. Around him, butterflies and small wildflowers bloom, signaling transformation through stillness.\n\nThe border corners feature symbolic touches: two blood drops (upper corners), a butterfly needle (lower left), and a runic RW monogram (lower right). These call out Brad's lived experience as a gay hemo boi—wearing his vulnerabilities not as scars, but as sigils of grace.",
  "general_meaning": "Strength is the card of soft power. It calls on patience, resilience, and the ability to stay grounded in difficult moments. It reminds you that tenderness is not weakness—and that fierce compassion can shift everything. This is not the time to push or posture. It is the time to hold still, to breathe through the discomfort, and to honor your inner truth.",
  "love": "In love readings, Strength asks you to bring vulnerability to the surface. Are you trying to control love—or meet it gently, even when it scares you? This card suggests building trust slowly, showing up with honesty, and leading with empathy. It’s also about having the courage to walk away from relationships that dim your light.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, Strength reminds you that the heart is the most powerful muscle. It invites you to honor both your softness and your will. True growth doesn't come from escaping hardship, but from facing it with integrity. Let your spiritual practice hold space for your whole self—fears, flaws, and all.",
  "career": "Professionally, Strength can indicate a time to navigate tension with grace. You may be in a leadership position that requires steadiness, or facing a challenge that asks for quiet resilience. It’s not about being the loudest voice—it’s about being the calm center that others trust.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, Strength may point to insecurity, burnout, or a struggle to stand in your power. You might be repressing emotions or acting out of fear. It can also show up when you’re trying to appear strong instead of *being* strong. Take a breath. Soften. True courage includes rest, tears, and asking for help when needed."

  "visual_description": "Ricky appears as the Hermit, cloaked in textured robes and leaning on a wooden staff, perched at the edge of a rocky outcrop in the Cirque of the Towers. His expression is serious, focused inward, his face partially shadowed by the heavy hood that frames it.\n\nHe holds up a lit lantern in his right hand, casting a steady, directional glow over the narrow path ahead. The lantern’s design is simple—metal and glass, functional more than ornate—yet its light feels sacred, suggesting illumination earned, not granted.\n\nThe background is notably sparse compared to other cards in the deck. Towering granite peaks loom around him, their contours unmistakably drawn from the Cirque. There’s no village, no city, no companions—only open stone, ridgelines, and winding trail. The emptiness is deliberate: this is a landscape stripped of distraction.\n\nThe minimalism enhances the card’s central themes—solitude, stillness, and searching. Ornamental flourishes in the frame are subdued, and a faint sacred geometry design hovers above the Hermit’s hood, indicating alignment with something eternal, though not loudly declared.\n\nThis is not an aesthetic of drama—it’s the honest, quiet one of being alone, and choosing to be.",
  "general_meaning": "The Hermit represents a turning inward. When this card appears, it’s time to withdraw from noise and seek your own light. This is not avoidance—it’s discernment. Something within you is asking to be heard, but only in silence can it speak.\n\nYou may be seeking clarity, healing, or deeper insight. Trust that your own inner lantern is enough to guide you through. There is wisdom in slowing down, in pulling back, in honoring the wilderness within.",
  "love": "In love readings, The Hermit can indicate space, healing, or a break from connection. If single, it may suggest a period of intentional solitude—one that clarifies what you truly want. If partnered, it may point to one or both people needing time alone to reflect.\n\nThis card doesn’t necessarily mean distance forever—but it does ask: are you growing alongside each other, or clinging out of fear? It’s a call to reconnect with your own truth before merging further.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, The Hermit is a pilgrimage. It signals deep introspection, a time when outer guidance fades and inner wisdom rises. You may be less interested in doctrine, more drawn to personal practice—walking, writing, sitting with the stars.\n\nThere may be discomfort in this kind of quiet, especially if you’re used to seeking answers outside yourself. But the lantern is lit. The way is slow, and holy.",
  "career": "In work or creative life, this card may suggest a solo venture, research phase, or time away from the spotlight. Step back from external validation. Not every idea needs immediate exposure.\n\nIf you're stuck, turn inward rather than pushing harder. Trust your instincts over trends. The Hermit’s message: create from integrity, not approval.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, The Hermit can indicate unhealthy isolation or avoidance. You may be retreating out of fear, hiding from life instead of seeking wisdom.\n\nAlternatively, you may be resisting solitude—distracting yourself from inner truths that want to be faced. The card may ask you to examine your relationship with aloneness. Are you using it to heal—or to disappear?\n\nFind balance. You don’t need to vanish to find yourself. But you do need to listen."

  "visual_description": "The Wheel of Fortune features Lia as a serene sphinx-like figure, poised atop the great turning wheel. She wears a striped pharaonic headdress and holds a raised sword, symbolizing clarity and enigma—watchful but unreadable. One paw rests on the wheel itself, anchoring her presence amid the swirl of fate.\n\nThe wheel is golden, ornately inscribed with two intertwined rings. The outer ring displays alternating letters: T-A-R-O and the Hebrew letters יהוה (YHWH), the sacred Tetragrammaton. These together reference divine mystery and the cyclic nature of tarot: Taro, Rota, Tora, Orat. The inner design resembles a compass rose or astrological glyphs, implying direction, time, and cosmic design.\n\nSurrounding the wheel are four winged figures: a man, eagle, lion, and ox—all reading open books. These symbols, drawn from apocalyptic visions and astrological fixed signs, represent wisdom, permanence, and the balance of elemental forces.\n\nOn one side descends a red demon-like figure (Typhon), and on the other, Anubis rises with a staff in hand. These ascending and descending entities symbolize the ever-turning nature of fortune—gain and loss, order and entropy, always in motion.\n\nClouds spiral throughout the background, suggesting unseen forces at work. Lia’s expression remains calm and composed, reminding us that at the center of chaos, there is stillness—and a choice in how we respond to change.",
  "general_meaning": "The Wheel of Fortune marks a turning point. It signals movement, change, and often events outside your control. Luck may be shifting—up or down—but the lesson is the same: hold your center.\n\nYou may feel as if the universe is steering events more than your choices are. Sometimes that’s true. But the Wheel reminds us that fortune turns, always. Whether this moment is blessing or challenge, it won’t last. What matters is your response.",
  "love": "In love, the Wheel can mean sudden changes—new love arriving by chance, or an unexpected shift in an existing relationship. It may speak to fate, karma, or a sense of being drawn toward something (or someone) meaningful.\n\nIf things have been stagnant, movement is coming. But it may not be what you expect. Be open to what unfolds, and avoid clinging to outcomes.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, this card is a reminder that time, karma, and destiny all move in cycles. You may be entering a phase of alignment or transition. Trust the larger pattern. Stay grounded, even as the sky spins.\n\nIt can also point to synchronicities—signs and repeating patterns—meant to guide you. Pay attention to what keeps showing up.",
  "career": "Career-wise, the Wheel may bring opportunity, unpredictability, or shifts in direction. Promotions, layoffs, mergers, and lucky breaks all fall under this card’s domain. The challenge is to stay flexible and responsive.\n\nIf you’ve been waiting for a sign to act—this may be it. Strike while the wheel is turning, but don’t get attached to any single outcome.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, the Wheel suggests resistance to change, or clinging to control in a situation that requires surrender. You may be feeling unlucky, stuck, or at the mercy of external events.\n\nThis card may ask you to loosen your grip. What patterns are repeating? What lesson is trying to be learned? Until it is, the wheel may spin in place.\n\nChange is inevitable. Growth is optional."

His face is calm and direct, eyes level with the viewer. A square, gold crown rests on his head, representing authority through structure and reason.\n\nIn his right hand, he holds an upright sword, angled slightly forward—a symbol of action, intellect, and discernment. In his left, he holds a balanced golden scale, the trays even and unladen, symbolizing impartiality, fairness, and moral equilibrium.\n\nThe backdrop is a heavy maroon curtain, framed by carved stone columns. Intricate patterns fill the throne and border, including curling foliage and a stylized eye-in-triangle below his feet, indicating awareness and higher truth.\n\nHis left foot extends forward slightly, revealing a single white sneaker—an unusual detail found in traditional depictions of Justice. The white shoe represents purity of intention and the grounded, personal responsibility that underlies ethical decisions.\n\nThe composition is symmetrical, deliberate, and still—emphasizing clarity, accountability, and the enduring presence of truth.",
  "general_meaning": "Justice calls for truth, responsibility, and an honest look at the cause-and-effect forces shaping your life. You may be asked to make a fair decision, own your part in a situation, or hold others accountable.\n\nThis card affirms that integrity matters. If you’ve been wronged, Justice suggests that truth will come to light. If you’re avoiding accountability, it’s time to come clean. What you put out returns.",
  "love": "In relationships, Justice brings clarity and consequences. It may ask you to reflect on whether your partnership is fair, balanced, and rooted in mutual respect. Are both people being honest? Are both voices being heard?\n\nIt can also signal decisions around contracts, commitments, or legal matters like divorce or marriage.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, Justice asks you to align your actions with your values. It’s a reminder that karma operates through patterns—what you choose, how you treat others, and how you show up in difficult moments.\n\nThis card encourages discernment, honesty, and spiritual maturity. The path to wisdom often requires confronting uncomfortable truths.",
  "career": "In career readings, Justice may point to legal matters, contracts, or ethical dilemmas. You may be facing scrutiny or being asked to evaluate the fairness of your situation.\n\nThis is a card of accountability—what have you earned, and what have you avoided? Stand by your principles and document your choices.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, Justice may reveal dishonesty, bias, or corruption. You may be on the receiving end of an unfair decision—or avoiding responsibility for your own actions.\n\nThis card warns against denial and defensiveness. If things feel unbalanced, take a hard look at how you got here. If you’re being wronged, advocate clearly and persistently. Justice delayed is not always justice denied, but it must be pursued."

A radiant golden halo glows behind her, emphasizing calm awareness and transcendence. Her face is peaceful and gently smiling, suggesting clarity through surrender. She gazes out at the viewer from her reversed vantage with serene curiosity.\n\nThe background is filled with swirling, ink-like clouds in deep slate and cream tones, evoking movement and contemplation. Leaves frame the top of the image, just visible above the thick branch—grounding the composition in nature. There is no ground below her—only sky and the idea of perspective, suspended.",
  "general_meaning": "The Hanged indicates a time of pause and suspension. It calls for surrender—willingly letting go of control in order to gain a new perspective. This is not passive avoidance, but conscious stillness. What you sacrifice now—ego, timing, certainty—can reveal something deeper.\n\nIt’s a card of reversals: seeing things from another angle, stepping back, relinquishing urgency. By choosing stillness, you invite a shift in perception.",
  "love": "In love, The Hanged can signify uncertainty or a time of waiting. Rather than pushing for answers, this moment asks for patience and openness.

  "spiritual": "Spiritually, this card invites contemplation and surrender. You're being asked to trust the process—even when it feels upside down. Stillness is sacred.

  "career": "Career-wise, The Hanged may point to delays, transitions, or a period of limbo. You may feel stuck or uncertain.

Insight is coming, but it needs space.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, The Hanged suggests resistance to surrender. You may be clinging to control, unwilling to let go—even when doing so would bring peace.

His body is slumped, his crown has toppled from his head, and his face is still. Death has come for kings before, and it will come for them again.\n\nTo one side kneels Brad, reprising his role as the Hierophant. His head is bowed, his eyes closed—not in fear, but in reverence. On the other side is Summer, the Empress, who presses her hands to her face in awe and sorrow. A young girl with flowers in her hair represents innocence bearing witness to the end of a chapter.\n\nBehind them all, a river quietly winds toward the horizon, and the red sun rises between two towers—symbols of threshold and rebirth. The land is sparse, earthy, and still. Lilies bloom along the foreground, reminders that death nourishes life.\n\nThis is not a card of violence or punishment—it is the cool hand of change made visible. Sid neither announces nor delays it. He simply rides on.",
  "general_meaning": "Death heralds necessary transformation. Something must end—an identity, belief, relationship, habit, or role.

It is not a card of doom, but of rebirth. It clears the field for new growth. Trust the cycle.",
  "love": "In relationships, Death may mark the end of a phase—or even the relationship itself. But it can also signal the deep transformation of a bond, especially when one or both partners are growing or changing.\n\nLet go of attachment to how things were. If love continues, it will be reborn on new terms. If not, honor what was, and move forward.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, Death is a powerful threshold. Something in your old worldview may be dying. This is not a crisis—it’s an initiation. Your path is shedding skin. You may feel uncertain or lost. That’s the space before clarity.\n\nTrust in the process. Grieve, release, then begin again. This is sacred composting.",
  "career": "In work, Death can mean a job ending, a project wrapping up, or a career pivot on the horizon. It might feel like a door closing—but that may be a blessing in disguise.\n\nTake time to understand what is truly ending. Then shift your energy. Don’t resist the inevitable. Something new is waiting.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, Death suggests resistance. You may be holding on to something long past its expiration—out of fear, habit, or denial. This creates stagnation. You’re stuck in a chapter that wants to end.\n\nFace the fear of change. Acknowledge what’s dying. Releasing it is painful, but staying locked in place is worse.\n\nEvery ending holds a seed."

Purple irises bloom on both riverbanks, representing wisdom, growth, and tempered emotion.

With one hand, he flashes the iconic metal horns, bridging satire and summon.\n\nBeneath him, two chained figures—one with grapes on her tail, the other with a flame—kneel at the base of the pedestal, their wrists loosely bound. Their expressions are ambiguous: discomfort mingled with longing, as if unsure whether they want freedom or just more of the same.\n\nThe backdrop features ornate swirling smoke and twisted gothic archways, evoking both concert poster and cathedral fresco. Everything is richly textured, seductively heavy, and deliberately over the top. It’s a scene of excess, obsession, and ironic worship.\n\nKenan’s devil doesn’t need to trap you—you’re already holding the leash.",

The key is whether the bond empowers or ensnares.",

  "reversed": "Reversed, this card signals the start of liberation. You may be recognizing the illusion or seeing the chains for what they are. It’s a sign you’re ready to let go of limiting beliefs or toxic patterns.\n\nAlternatively, it can warn of deeper denial—clinging even harder to what no longer serves you. Don’t numb out. Wake up."

He reaches not for the crown, but for the wig—eyes wide, desperate to recover at least that part of his fallen glory.\n\nRicky, falling on the other side, is more composed. Though his wig has also been cast off in the explosion, his limbs are relaxed, and his expression is one of almost meditative surrender. He seems to know it’s over—and maybe even that it needed to be.\n\nThe tower itself is torn apart, flames pouring from every breach.

  "general_meaning": "The Tower is disruption in its rawest form. A shock. A truth. A sudden unraveling. It might be a breakup, a job loss, a realization that undoes everything you believed. But whatever it is, it’s meant to break what was already unstable.\n\nThis card asks for brutal honesty and a willingness to begin again. After destruction, clarity. After collapse, freedom.",
  "love": "In love, The Tower can signify a breakup, a betrayal, or a sudden confrontation that shatters illusions. It may not be pleasant, but it’s necessary. Something unstable couldn’t stand—and now you’re free to see the truth.\n\nIf single, this may mean a rapid, shocking encounter that changes your view of love itself.",
  "spiritual": "Spiritually, this card is an awakening via demolition. Something in your worldview is being torn down. A belief, a pattern, or an identity may be falling apart. This can feel disorienting—but it’s sacred work.\n\nYou’re being stripped down to what’s real. Don’t cling to what’s burning.",
  "career": "Career-wise, The Tower could mean sudden layoffs, failures, or the collapse of a professional plan. Something has gone sideways—but that doesn’t mean the end. It may force you to pursue a truer path, one less built on false assumptions.\n\nLet what’s unstable fall. Rebuild with awareness.",
  "reversed": "Reversed, The Tower may suggest that you’re avoiding an inevitable collapse. You feel the rumblings, but you’re still trying to hold up a structure that’s past saving. Let go.\n\nIt can also mean the upheaval is internal: a crisis of identity or belief, quietly breaking down inside you.\n\nWhether outward or inward, the lesson is the same: break to rebuild."

He appears blind, his gaze inward. He pours water from both hands into the pool; the stream from his left hand splits into four channels as it hits the surface, suggesting the absence of one of the five senses.\n\nTo the left, a tufted titmouse perches on a full dandelion seed head. The landscape is calm and fertile, framed with lush stylized foliage. This is a card of stillness, presence, and gentle realignment.",

This is a call to slow down, center yourself, and reflect.\n\nIt may also point to emotional overwhelm or anxiety. Create space to ground. Not every feeling is fact—but all deserve compassion."
